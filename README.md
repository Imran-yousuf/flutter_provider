# flutter_provider
Provider Concept in Flutter and Expose the API from Coingecko 
Providers allow you to not only expose a value, but also create, listen, and dispose of it.
in This code we will use a dropdown widget, and after each selection of dropdown value we will call an API and get the current value of Crypto Currency and other related 
information provided by Coingecko.
